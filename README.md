## 🧠 Project Summary
**I-XRAY** is a groundbreaking research prototype that integrates **AI-driven facial recognition** with **Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses**, demonstrating the convergence of **wearable technology, data aggregation, and artificial intelligence**.  
Developed originally by Harvard undergraduates, this system exposes how easily public data can be exploited to identify individuals in real-time — serving as a cautionary case study in **AI ethics, privacy, and surveillance technology**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Concept
I-XRAY uses:
- **Smart Glasses Cameras** → capture high-resolution facial images.  
- **AI Facial Recognition (PimEyes-style CNNs)** → match faces to online public datasets.  
- **Data Aggregation Pipelines** → retrieve linked personal data (name, address, social profiles).  
- **Mobile App Interface** → display identity details instantly.  

This end-to-end architecture demonstrates how **publicly available data + real-time AI** can compromise anonymity and redefine digital privacy boundaries.

## 🔍 Key Research Dimensions
- **Technological Framework:** Integration of AI, wearable sensors, and cloud data retrieval.  
- **Ethical Analysis:** Challenges informed consent, data ownership, and algorithmic misuse.  
- **Societal Impact:** Highlights erosion of anonymity, behavioral shifts, and surveillance culture.  
- **Regulatory Gaps:** Exposes how GDPR and CCPA fail to address real-time AI identification.  
- **Global Context:** Compares I-XRAY with systems like **Clearview AI**, **Amazon Rekognition**, and **China’s national surveillance network**.

---

## 🧩 Major Insights
- Public data aggregation transforms harmless information into invasive intelligence.  
- Current legal frameworks are **insufficient for AI-wearable convergence**.  
- Ethical AI design must incorporate **consent-based safeguards** and **anonymity rights**.  
- The project illustrates the dual nature of technology — innovation vs. exploitation.  

---

## 🌍 Future Outlook
- Integration of **AR (Augmented Reality)** and **AI** could expand real-time information overlays.  
- Counter-surveillance solutions (adversarial fashion, facial obfuscation) may emerge in response.  
- Global policy reforms and **privacy-first AI frameworks** will be vital for ethical innovation.

---

## 🧠 Core Message
> “I-XRAY is not just a prototype — it’s a wake-up call for the world.  
> It reveals that in the era of AI, privacy is no longer lost in data breaches —  
> it’s lost in plain sight.”
